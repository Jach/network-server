Dependencies and reverse dependencies are names composed of
the string 'publisher-package-version'. When a package is net_install'ed
its dependencies are automatically installed. When a package is net_remove'd
its reverse dependencies are automatically removed.

Optional, the 'url' tag. If specified, we will download whatever is at
the specified url endpoint. If unspecified, we will download the file named
from the composition of 'publisher-package-version.jar' and downloaded via
the same directory and server hosting this metadata.
